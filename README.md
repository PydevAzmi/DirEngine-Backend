## Features

- **Django Framework**: The project is built using the Django framework, a powerful and flexible web development framework in Python.

- **Docker**: Docker is used to containerize the application, making it easier to deploy and manage. It ensures consistent environments across development, testing, and production stages.

- **Celery**: Celery is an asynchronous task queue that is utilized to handle background tasks such as sending notifications, processing bookings, and generating personalized recommendations. This enhances the responsiveness of the application and ensures smooth user interactions.

- **Database Management**: The backend interacts with a database to store and retrieve relevant data. We have utilized Django's built-in ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) to handle database operations efficiently.

- **Redis**: Redis serves as a message broker and caching mechanism in the project. It allows Celery to distribute tasks efficiently across multiple workers, leading to better performance and scalability. Additionally, Redis caching improves data retrieval speed and reduces the load on the database.
